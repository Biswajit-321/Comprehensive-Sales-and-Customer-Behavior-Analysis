## Comprehensive Sales and Customer Behavior Analysis
#:Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing sales and customer behavior using an Amazon dataset. The analysis was conducted using SQL to extract key insights, and Power BI was used to visualize the results. The aim of this project is to understand customer preferences, payment methods, time-of-day sales trends, product line performance, and satisfaction trends across branches and time periods.

:Dataset:
The dataset consists of sales transaction records, including:

Invoice ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
Branch: Location or branch where the transaction occurred.
City: City associated with the branch.
Customer Type: Whether the customer is a member or a walk-in.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Product Line: Category of products purchased.
Quantity: Number of units sold.
Unit Price: Price per unit.
Total: Total sales amount.
Date/Time: Date and time of the transaction.
Payment Method: Method used to make the purchase (e.g., Credit, Cash).
Rating: Customer satisfaction rating.
# Key Analysis Areas:  
1. Customer Type and Payment Method Analysis
SQL: Analyzed the distribution of customer types (e.g., members vs. walk-ins) and their preferred payment methods.
Power BI: Visualized the breakdown of payment methods used by different customer types, showing the most common methods and their corresponding revenue.
2. Time-of-Day Sales Trends and Peak Hours
SQL: Analyzed sales data to identify peak sales periods by categorizing transactions into morning, afternoon, and evening.
Power BI: Visualized sales trends throughout the day, highlighting the busiest hours and periods of highest revenue generation.
3. Product Line Performance by Gender and Customer Type
SQL: Evaluated the sales performance of different product lines based on customer gender and type (member vs. non-member).
Power BI: Visualized product line performance by gender, identifying which product lines are popular among different customer segments.
4. Rating and Satisfaction Trends Across Branches and Time Periods
SQL: Extracted customer satisfaction ratings to analyze trends across different branches and time periods (e.g., months, days).
Power BI: Visualized the average customer ratings by branch, identifying which branches have the highest customer satisfaction and how it varies over time.
# Tools Used
SQL: Used to perform data analysis, filtering, and aggregation to derive insights from the Amazon dataset.
Power BI: Used to visualize the results of the analysis with interactive dashboards and reports.
Visualizations include bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to represent trends in sales, customer behavior, and satisfaction.
# Results
Customer Behavior: Identified key customer segments, with members contributing more to sales and using a variety of payment methods.
Peak Sales: Highlighted peak sales hours, showing when the most revenue is generated.
Product Line Insights: Showed gender-based preferences for certain product lines, helping to target marketing efforts.
Branch Performance: Provided insights into branch-wise performance, including customer satisfaction and revenue trends.
# Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive view of sales and customer behavior using SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization. The insights gained from this project can help optimize sales strategies, improve customer targeting, and enhance overall business decision-making.
